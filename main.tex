\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2019} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2019} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2019}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2019}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2019
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\begin{abstract}
Thompson Sampling method can achieve effective exploration in the reinforcement learning, but many existing works fail in sparse/deceptive tasks. The factors of "zero reward" and "action penalty" prevent agents from exploring more states in sparse/deceptive environment, which makes the environment difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose an Thompson sampling exploration strategy based on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Actor-critic algorithm, which can archive exploration in a sparse/deceptive environment and overcomes the shortcomings of existing exploration methods. We measured the performance of our method in the three benchmarks: Countinous-MountainCar, SparseHalfCheetah, and HalfCheetah, which represent different attributes. The results show that our approach can solve more tasks, have higher sample efficiency, and lower computational cost. Our code is open source on github.com/anonymousforcodesubmit/SGLD.
